# BCAA for Weight Loss - Do BCAAs help you lose weight?

## What are BCAAs?

Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are among the **essential** amino acids for humans, they are:
 - Valine, 
 - Isoleucine, and 
 - Leucine. 
<br>

They are considered essential because **your body cannot make them** and you must **get them from your diet**.

They help in **muscle growth and recovery**. Since most protein sources are rich in them, it's usually unnecessary to supplement them. However, they are often taken with the goal of **boosting muscle growth and enhancing exercise performance** during weight training.

## How to use BCAAs?

### Taking BCAAs before or during a workout

Drinking BCAAs (which is the **easiest way** to get them in, in interesting quantities) a little while before or during your workout will give you a bit of a buffer against catabolism (in other words **breaking down protein molecules**). They might help with your energy levels during your training session, but that generally depends on which product you're buying.

### Taking BCAAs after a workout

Drinking BCAA's after your workout will help with the process of rebuilding muscle tissue and gaining muscle mass.

### Taking BCAAs fasted

If you're working out fasted (say, no solid meals in the 16 hours, either for intermittent fasting or some other reason), BCAAs can play the role of *real* protein for a while.

## Do BCAAs help you lose weight?

Branched-chain amino acids may aid in losing weight, as concluded in a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3313152/) conducted by the *Weider Research Group* on *"Thirty-six strength-trained males with a minimum of two years resistance-training experience"*. 

The study concluded that **ingesting BCAAs while on a weight training program resulted in a great decrease in percent body fat** and *"an increase in lean mass, and strength gains on the bench press and squat"* in comparison to the *"ingestion of a whey supplement or a sports drink*".
