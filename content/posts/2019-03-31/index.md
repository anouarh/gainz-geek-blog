# The Complete Guide: How to Start Working Out

When I first wanted to start working out, the sheer volume of ressources available was very overwhelming. This is an attempt to regroup everything that a beginner should need in order to start.

## First, some terminology

**3x8** - this reads as *three sets of eight*. <br />
**2x4, 1x4+** - this reads as, *two sets of 4, one of set of at least 4, but as many as possible*. <br />
**SS** - this reads as superset (two exercices done back to back with no rest in between). <br />
**BB** - *Barbell* <br />
**DB** - *Dumbbell* <br />

## What should a beginner do at the gym?

### Set a primary fitness goal

Well, first things first, you have to determine **your primary fitness goal**. These can be grouped into 6 main categories (there is of course some overlap between them): <br />
- Muscle Gain
- Fat Loss
- Flexibility
- Cardio/Endurance
- Posture Improvement
- Bodyweight Training

### Determine your level of commitment

#### Time

After deciding on a fitness goal, it is important to decide **how many days per week are you willing to commit** to reach it. Now, you need to be realistic with yourself, for instance, you can not expect to lose a lot of weight in a small period of time while doing cardio once a week. It takes **time and commitment**. Those *Lose Weight in 10 days* and *Get Bigger Muscles with this Simple 7 minute Workout*  articles are obviously taking advantage of people's desire to reach those goals without doing much effort. The good news is **doing something is better than doing nothing**.

#### Budget

Of course, it all comes down to the budget. Wouldn't be nice to just hire a personal trainer? Yes, it would. However, that's not our goal here. You have to be able to use your money wisely. **Set an amount you are willing to spend** monthly on your gym subscription, home gym gear, bodyweight training equipment etc. And most importantly on food.

### Understand the importance of diet
